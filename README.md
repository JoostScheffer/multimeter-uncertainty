## ABOUT THE MULTIMETER-UNCERTAINTY-SIMULATION CODE
first of all, the digital multimeter this can be used for is the DMM TTi 1604. If you use another multimeter the uncertainties will vary.
In this code the uncertainty for the multimeter will be calculated in the simplest way I saw possible.

### How to use
- The code can be run on every platform that has a library with tkinter in it. Luckily most libraries have tkinter. Examples are spyder or visual studio code. even sublime text has tkinter.
- When running the code you go to the homescreen. here you can select what you messured (voltage, amperage or resistance). You click on what you messured, make sure you know if you messured either AC or DC. Else the results can deffer. 
- After that you select the unit, kilo, mili, micro etc. 
- When you get past that there will be a little pop-up screen asking you how much you messured. voltage AC has two pop-up screens because the Hz on which you messured
also plays a big role there. 
- And final, you get a last pop-up with what you messured, the fitting uncertainty and the unit in which you messsured.

have fun!

### Bugs in the code
If you find any bugs or you know where to improve the code, create a new issue or issue a pull-request! All help is welcome.
